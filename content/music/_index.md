I keep a music journal to make my musical life observable to others. I use it to share what I play, when I write, and when I record, sharing the creative process as it takes place over time.

Most of my musical time goes towards a band I do by myself, _american f00d_.

# Old Projects

Each of these were once the most important thing in my life. They all have stories worth sharing and music we loved making.
