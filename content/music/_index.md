I first picked up a guitar around 11, had my first band a couple years later, made a few records before finishing high school, and soon enough, I was in a van touring the US & Canada. I've had several bands since then, written a lot of music, and I still play live whenever I can. I haven't toured in years, though.

# Current Projects

Most of my musical time goes towards a band I do by myself, _American Food_.

My _Music Journal_ makes the things I think & feel observable to others as I play, write, or record music.

# Old Projects

Each of these were once the most important thing in my life. They all have stories worth sharing and music we loved making.
