I first picked up a guitar around 11, had my first band a couple years later, made a few records before finishing high school, and soon enough, I was in a van touring the US & Canada. I've had several bands since then, written a lot of music, and I still play live whenever I can. I haven't toured in years, though.

# Current Projects

I am putting most of my musical energy into my first solo project.

# Thinking Out Loud

I am starting a journal to share what I think & feel about music as I play it, create it, record it, and release it.

# Old Bands


Each of these bands were once the most important thing in my life. They all have stories worth sharing and music we loved making.
