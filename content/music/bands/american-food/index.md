American Food is a musical experiement.

This project began as a way to use music as a vehicle for social commentary. What's being said in the lyrics guides how the music should feel, for satire. I found it interesting how that changed the role of musical genre _from_ a personal identity _to_ a stylistic choice. I then expanded on that into something more intentional.


## The Plan

This project will release new music in the form of three song EPs, each with a distinct personality that drives both what's being said and what style of music is best for saying it. The band itself won't have a genre, but every EP will.

This project is just getting started, but it's coming.
