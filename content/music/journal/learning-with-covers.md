I have been teaching myself how to record music for several years. To get started, I figured I should do a bunch of cover songs and I would switch to recording my own music once I got the hang of it. I never shared the covers beyond a few friends who were giving me feedback to help me get better. I meant to, but I got too excited to record my own music once my skills were good enough, so I forgot and never looked back until this week.

So, here they are! 5 of the best cover songs I tracked while learning how to record. These songs represent the best of what I was listening to back around 1999 and 2000. I still love these songs as much as I did back then too.
