I have been teaching myself how to record music for several years. To get started, I figured I should do a bunch of cover songs where I play drums, bass, the guitars, and sing to quickly create a bunch of data for me to learn with. Once I got the hang of it, I would switch to recording my own music. This is what I did to learn how to record so I could then record the music I wrote for [American Food]({{<ref americanf00d >}}).

I never shared these covers, except with a few friends who were giving me feedback to help me improve. I meant to, but I got too excited to record my own music once my skills were good enough, so I got started doing that and never looked back.

The first American Food EP that I tracked was Street Fight. It's the angry political one. I didn't know how to record punk rock well and wanted to learn how by actually recording punk songs, so I did a bunch of covers for songs that felt like they got the whole sonic vibe right.

You'll hear fluctuation in the quality of the songs, but I think they all sound pretty good too. The doubled vocals are really audible in This Is A Call. The kick could've been louder in Linoleum. But also, none of that matters. They're things I made while learning. Sonic sketches in an audio composition pad.
