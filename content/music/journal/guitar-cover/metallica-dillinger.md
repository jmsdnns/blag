     This batch of guitar covers are total shredfests. I even dress as George Washington for the Metallica cover because I'm convinced he'd love that band.

# Master Of Puppets, by Metallica

I'm dressed as George Washington for this one. I've played this song on guitar since I was 12, and I still love playing it on guitar. This song is so long and requires serious endurance for all the downpicking.

# Baby's First Coffin, by Dillinger Escape Plan

This band is probably the most chaotic band I've ever seen or heard. The musicianship required to play their stuff is surreal. I play one of their easier songs in this video.
