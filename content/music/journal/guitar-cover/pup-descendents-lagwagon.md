     These songs are less about playing complicated things at high speed and more about getting the attitude right. They're really fun to play!

# Totally Fine, by Pup

Power chords and lots of energy. I decided to try moving around more in front of the camera for this one, to see if it better expresses what I'm like on stage. It feels awkward, but I have a sense I need to do more of that.

# Coolidge, by Descendents

My first punk song! [Counterfit]({{< ref "counterfit" >}}) covered this one when we first moved to California and played it live a few times. I learned about it them when they were on the soundtrack for a Thrasher skate video. They are considered the first _pop-punk_ band and influenced all the punk that came after them, especially in the 90's.

# Dis'chords, by Lagwagon

I have spent a lot of time studying this band. They were one of my favorites in high school. This record in particular, because it's basically Metallica but in major scales, which was a perfect fit for who I was back then. Hyper and generally happy, unlike the anger found in metal.
