    I made a bunch more guitar videos. Some of them are wild shredfests and some are easy. George Washington shows up again to play Master Of Puppets too.

## Master Of Puppets, by Metallica

I'm dressed as George Washington for this one. I've played this song on guitar since I was 12, and I still love playing it on guitar. This song is so long and requires serious endurance for all the downpicking.

## Baby's First Coffin, by Dillinger Escape Plan

This band is probably the most chaotic band I've ever seen or heard. The musicianship required to play their stuff is surreal. I play one of their easier songs in this video.

## Totally Fine, by Pup

Power chords and lots of energy. I decided to try moving around more in front of the camera for this one, to see if it better expresses what I'm like on stage. It feels awkward, but I have a sense I need to do more of that.

## Coolidge, by Descendents

My first punk song! [Counterfit]({{< ref "counterfit" >}}) covered this one when we first moved to California and played it live a few times. I learned about it them when they were on the soundtrack for a Thrasher skate video. They are considered the first _pop-punk_ band and influenced all the punk that came after them, especially in the 90's.

## Dis'chords, by Lagwagon

I have spent a lot of time studying this band. They were one of my favorites in high school. This record in particular, because it's basically Metallica but in major scales, which was a perfect fit for who I was back then. Hyper and generally happy, unlike the anger found in metal.
