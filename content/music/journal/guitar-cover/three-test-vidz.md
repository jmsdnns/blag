I have done several drumming videos, but it occurred to me that I should also make some guitar videos. I've played guitar for 20 more years than I've played drums, after all.

## Shower Days, by NOFX

I adore this absurd song. The guitars are a punk rock shred fest and the lyrics are about not wanting to take a shower more than twice a week. 15 year old me fell in love with this song the first time I heard it and I've adored it ever since.

## Dousing This Flame, by Overcast

Overcast were hometown heroes for the New England metal scene in the 90's. I was at their last show at the Tune Inn in New Haven, way back when, and was thrilled when TWO amazing bands emerged from Overcast's ashes: Shadow's Fall and Killswitch Engage. This is one of my favorite Overcast songs and I dressed like George Washington for the guitar cover.

## Power Mustache, by The Vandals

This was the first guitar covers video I made. This song is so hyper and ridiculous. The lyrics are about how we can never trust anyone who seeks power and has a mustache. It's one of the first songs where I heard Josh Freese on drums too. I can play it on drums and guitar and do so regularly.
