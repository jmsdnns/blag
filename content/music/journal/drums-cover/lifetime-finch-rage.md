# Rodeo Clown, by Lifetime

Scott Golley. What an animal he is on the drums. He has that rare ability to play insanely fast with a solid groove that the whole band's rhythm just locks into. He's one of my biggest influences and this is one of my favorite Lifetime songs.

# The Casket of Roderick Usher, by Finch

One of my favorite Finch songs on a criminally underrated album. This video is also the first time I have covered drumming done by a friend. The drummer on this album is the same Marc Allen I started three bands with in high school. He is a BEAST on this record, especially this song.

# Tire Me, by Rage Against The Machine

This is my favorite Rage song. It is punk af while retaining Rage's mighty fingerprint. I love it so much.
