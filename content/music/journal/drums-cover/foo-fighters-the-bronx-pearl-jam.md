# Everlong, by Foo Fighters

What could I say about Dave Grohl's drumming that hasn't already been said? This is a bird's-eye view of me playing drums to a legendary Foo Fighters song.

# False Alarm, by The Bronx

Jorma Vik is one of the most tasteful punk drummers out there. His drum tones are incredible and his grooves align so well with the bands he plays for that you almost forget how complicated his patterns actually are.

# Go, by Pearl Jam

This song has some of my favorite drumming of all time. I am not a big fan of Pearl Jam, but I have been playing the drums to this particular song for years.
