My first punk song! [Counterfit]({{< ref "counterfit" >}}) covered this one when we first moved to California and played it live a few times. I learned about it them when they were on the soundtrack for a Thrasher skate video. They are considered the first _pop-punk_ band and influenced all the punk that came after them, especially in the 90's.
