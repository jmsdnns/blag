Overcast were hometown heroes for the New England metal scene in the 90's. I was at their last show at the Tune Inn in New Haven, way back when, and was thrilled when TWO amazing bands emerged from Overcast's ashes: Shadow's Fall and Killswitch Engage. This is one of my favorite Overcast songs and I dressed like George Washington for the guitar cover.
