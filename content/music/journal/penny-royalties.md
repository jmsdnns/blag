I played drums in a Nirvana cover band for Halloween back in October 29th, 2016. We wanted to celebrate the 25th anniversary of Nirvana's Nevermind. After years of being a huge fan, I was thrilled to finally perform some of Dave Grohl's drumming.

We called ourselves The Penny Royalties and we played all of Nevermind, front to back.
