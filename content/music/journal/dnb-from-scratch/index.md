    I tried an experiment recently where I wrote a drum n bass track with guitars, a bass, and drums. That isn't how it's usually done!

I have listened to drum n bass for a long time. For me, it always felt like the punk rock side of EDM. It was also super tech with a lot going on, giving it a vibe like controlled chaos.

The drumming, but also the sonic treatment of the drums, was like nothing I'd ever heard and it pulled me in. The drums in dnb is so unusual because it comes from speeding up funk drumming played by humans. It can be fast and hectic, yet tight and clean too.

I've been interested in trying to recreate the process the early junglists used but wasn't quite sure how to write an entire song, to complete the idea. I wanted to record myself playing funk drums, speed that up, and then write the dnb song on top of that.

I finally gave it a go and I'm pretty pumped on how it turned out. It wasn't perfect, because I didn't have a lot of time, but I definitely want to do write more dnb soon! 

I'm calling the project Amphase.
