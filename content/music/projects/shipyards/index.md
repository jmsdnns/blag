Shipyards was a short lived indie rock band from Brooklyn, NY.

I started Shipyards in 2007 with JP Chirdon and Brian Pile, who I played with in First Aid Kit. We started jamming and writing and eventually formed a whole band with some old friends. It split in 2009 when one of the band members moved to Norway.

For me, this band feels like one that had so much potential, but never had a real chance to flourish.


# Recordings

## A Dream Is A Town

Our first EP. We recorded this with Greg Giorgio. The music here captures a love of Dave Brubeck, Radiohead, and good ol' fashioned blues rock.

# Videos

This song comes from a batch of songs that never got released properly, after the band's first EP. This video captures our last performance of one of our best songs.
