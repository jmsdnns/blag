american f00d is a musical experiement.

This project began as a way to use music as a vehicle for social commentary. What's being said in the lyrics guides how the music should sound & feel. I found it interesting how that changed the role of musical genre from _a band identity_ to _a stylistic choice_.

This _band_, which is just me and a laptop, writes music in any genre featuring guitars & drums. However, to keep things organized, music will be released in the form of three song EPs, each with a distinct personality that drives both what's being said and what genre of music is best for saying it. The band itself won't have a genre, but every EP will.


# Two Previews

## Cane Spiders

This song is one of the best things I've ever written. It has 3 guitar solos, 7 singing voices, and two drummers for the last 1/3 of the song. It tells a story about trying to overcome the ways we communicate to find understanding with people who think & speak differently from us.

It will be released as part of the EP _Internet On The TV_.

## Never Forget pt Deux

This song is an angry rocker that captures so much of what I felt on Jan 6th. It doesn't pull any punches, yet does so with a smirk, as though I never doubted they'd all pay for what they did.

It will be released as part of the EP _Street Fight_.
