American Food is a musical experiement.

This project began as a way to use music as a vehicle for social commentary. What's being said in the lyrics guides how the music should sound & feel, for satire. I found it interesting how that changed the role of musical genre from _a band identity_ to _a stylistic choice_.

# A Plan for EPs

This _band_, which is just me and a laptop, writes music in any genre featuring guitars & drums.

However, to keep things organized, music will be released in the form of three song EPs, each with a distinct personality that drives both what's being said and what genre of music is best for saying it. The band itself won't have a genre, but every EP will.

I've posted some song demos to Soundcloud.

I'm working up to posting videos on Youtube, but haven't gotten there yet.

And, when the EPs are done, they'll be on bandcamp. Not there yet either, but on the way.
