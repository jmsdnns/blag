# Career

I tend to stay near the **creative side of tech**, exploring things that aren't yet well understood. Modern technology makes it easy to move fast on ideas with small groups of people, and I embrace each opportunity. I am as comfortable being the person who writes the first line of code as I am navigating a huge project.

I have worked with a wide range of organizations, such as **Spotify**, **Venmo**, **HBOMax**, **Splice**, **The Whitney Museum**, **VHX**, **The Robin Hood Foundation**, **Bear Stearns** _and then JPMorgan_, **Harvard Law School**, and **Johns Hopkins University**.

I also have a computer science degree from **Northeastern University**. And I was in the inaugural batch of **Recurse Center**.

My early career resembled a dog chasing a ball. Most of my time went to projects where I could try something new. Lately, I prefer to focus on fewer things and build deeper expertise.

My current focus is **machine learning** && **MLOps**.


# Programming

Lately, I have been thinking a lot about the web & ML, and so I typically write code in **Javascript && Python**. I love learning new languages too, or databases, or new libraries... Keeping up is half the fun.

I sometimes work on open source software and I sometimes start open source projects too. Of all the projects I've started, **Schematics** is my favorite. It is a type system for Python that handles human types, like email addresses, URLs, etc. **Brubeck** was a concurrent server framework with strong opinions on web serving, concurrency, data modeling, and messaging. And **Micro Army** is a tool I made for testing Brubeck's performance. It works by instantiating a few hundred AWS Micros to flood some URL and report back the performance.

One of the more rewarding aspects of open source is learning where your work turns up. You've used where my open source played a role if you talk to Apple devices, read Huffington Post, wear Warby Parker sunglasses.


# Communities

You might know about some of the communities I have built: **Hack && Tell**, **Brooklyn Swift**, and **Dumbo Tech Breakfast**.

You can find me on various networks with the share links at the bottom of this page.
