I recently read Stacy Schiff's book on [Samuel Adams](https://stacyschiff.com/the-revolutionary-samuel-adams.html). I had been curious about Samuel's story after reading the histories of John Adams, the second US President, Samuel's cousin. Each of them mentioned a detail about John's trip to France, during the Revolution, that drops something huge about Samuel and then moves on without much explanation. The story usually goes, _while John was in France, he kept getting annoyed by people he met who always asked about his much more famous cousin, Samuel_. In the full context of a book about John, I have found it's surprisingly easy to hear that, take a moment to wonder, "_Wait, what was that? Why was Sam more famous?_" and then forget to ever look him up. You're reading a book about John, after all, not Samuel.

Beyond the beer, it's been my experience so far that Samuel is barely mentioned, if at all, when the revolutionary story is told. Samuel's actual story turned out to be a huge, incredible surprise. The dude was an unbelievable force of nature. His friends and families saw him as a noble, intelligent, generous, and energetic man. His foes found him so difficult they called him _the Machiavelli of Chaos_. WHAT a description that is. Right?

Thomas Jefferson puts him at a particular moment in US history by describing him as "_truly the man of the Revolution_". Turns out Samuel is arguably the single person most responsible for starting the Revolutionary War. While it's well known Jefferson wrote the Declaration of Independence, it usually isn't mentioned that he lifted the ideas, and some of the text, from things Samuel wrote earlier. Samuel even convinced a lot of colonists to drink coffee instead of tea because _[the beeessssst part of waaakiiiing up](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7LXSQ85jpw) is cancel cuuulllllture in yooouuuurrrr cup_.

While reading the book, I kept thinking there is an undeniable punk rock vibe to how he lived. If he were alive today, I'm certain he'd wear a black hoodie and he'd listen to [Fugazi](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_5OZOwAhas). There is an undeniable punk rock vibe to how he lived his life. He is the epitomy of resisting authority. By the time I was done with the book, I felt like the story had to be shared with all my punk friends. They don't usually care about history, but I felt like they'd see themselves in this story. Ideally, it would connect them to US history in way they're not used to.

My favorite way to consider the connection between Samuel and punk rock is to imagine him shouting _We owe you nothing! You have no control!_ as he tosses tea into Boston Harbor in 1773. Many of Fugazi's lyrics could be things Samuel said. That's surely why I found it so easy to see myself in his story. I shouted the same Fugazi lyrics in a Brooklyn basement in 2023 when I recorded myself playing the same song. My cover is embedded below because I hope you'll hit play and use it as a soundtrack for this amazing story. If any single person could be said to have started the Revolution it would be Samuel. It doesn't get more punk rock than resisting authority so hard you create a whole damn country.

# Whatever For 40 Years

> "Among the natural rights of the colonists are these: First a right to life, secondly to liberty, and thirdly to property; together with the right to defend them in the best manner they can."<br>
> – **Samuel Adams**


The first 40 years of Samuel's life are amusingly uneventful. His life is a riches to rags story. He went to Harvard and got one of the best educations available in the colonies and then did almost nothing with it. Money wasn't a priority for him at all. He was even proud of that. He once said, "_poverty is not as disagreeable as wealthy folks would have you believe_." That isn't too different from Fugazi singing, "_you are not what you own._"

It would be hard to know who he'd become by looking at who he was during this period. His peers at Harvard pulled all kinds of stunts, but Samuel didn't. He was late to something once and then never again. We start to see the rebellious spirit in the topic he chose for Master's degree: _Is it lawful to resist the supreme magistrate if the republic cannot otherwise be preserved?_

Samuel was born into one of those New England Puritan families that believed the Church of England hadn't reformed enough. The only thing he really cared about was living virtuously and God. Samuel didn't respond to flattery and he was distrustful of anyone who did. Ben Franklin once wrote an essay about his [13 Guidelines for Living a Good Life](https://bigthink.com/personal-growth/ben-franklins-13-guidelines-for-living-a-good-life/) and Samuel Adams lived them better than he did. 

He eventually inherits his father's business making malted barley and ran it into the ground, because he just didn't care enough about making money. He tried brewing beer but that didn't work either. He'd say he had no mind for all the bookkeeping, but he just loved politics too much to do anything else. Politics clearly came first when he was forced into a job as a tax collector for the King, because he wasn't paying off the debts he accrued running his businesses into the ground, only to do it badly on purpose. He was making a point and the people of Boston loved him for it.


# A Wild Man Appears

England had no idea what it was getting into with him. It's hard to know the full extent of what he did because he was so good at hiding his tracks and yet it couldn't have been easy to keep 130+ pseudonyms organized. Ben Franklin usually gets credit for being the father of US Intelligence, but Samuel Adams would be more deserving of a statue at CIA headquarters.

The motive for chaos begins roughly with the [Townshend Acts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Townshend_Acts), which were taxes and regulations imposed on the colonies as a response to the [French & Indian War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_and_Indian_War), which escalates into being one of the theaters of the [Seven Years' War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seven_Years%27_War), a war George Washington started by accident. England wanted the colonists to pay for a larger British presence, to protect them from the French and from the natives. They first tried with the Stamp Act of 1765, but that failed, so they followed up with laws that said England had a right to fully administer the colonies and that the colonists would pay for that with a tax. Needless to say, Samuel and many of the colonists weren't into it.

Samuel demonstrates his skill for propaganda when he and James Otis Jr write the [Massachusetts Circular Letter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massachusetts_Circular_Letter), calling for colonial non-cooperation with Britain. Samuel's letter was so effective that the governments of New Jersey, Connecticut, and Virginia all loved it. Thomas Jefferson later uses this letter as a template for the Declaration of Independence. It also scared / pissed off Britain so much that they began a military occupation of Boston, which the people of Boston didn't like.

On March 5, 1770, a crowd of 3-400 got rowdy enough to corner 9 British soldiers. They were harassing them and throwing things at them until one of them shot at the crowd. England called this the _Incident on King Street_, but Samuel and Paul Revere told the story to the colonies as [_The Boston Massacre_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Massacre). The English could not believe the way it was being spun in the colonies. To Britain, it was an act of self-defense from 9 cornered troops against upwards of 400 angry colonists, but to Samuel it was an opportunity to agitate. Samuel influenced the colonial newspapers to cover it as though Britain were oppressors. He wanted to unite the colonies against Britain and he wouldn't miss an opportunity to do so.

# Cancelling Anything English

> "Tea must be universally renounced."<br>
> – **John Adams**

The [Continental Association](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continental_Association) was created in 1774. The colonies were worried about Britain's reaction to the growing colonial boycott against British merchants. Samuel started that boycott. Samuel was at the First Continental Congress and signed the Continental Association. He knew what he was doing. He was going to use cancel culture to create a new nation.

One of my favorite examples of Samuel's cancelling prowess is the way he started a trend of choosing coffee over tea. This is the origin of the US love of coffee. In [a 1774 letter to his wife](https://founders.archives.gov/documents/Adams/04-01-02-0087), John Adams tells his wife about seeing some travellers who refused to drink tea unless it had been properly smuggled, to which the person running the establishment said "_we have renounced Team in this place. I can't make tea, but He make you Coffee._" John concludes the letter saying he loves coffee and hopes to see Tea universally renounced. Cancelling tea, and anything else British, was so successful that it brought an already strained East India Company's colonial business to its knees. England cared about their businesses more than they cared about the rights of colonists, so this got their attention.
