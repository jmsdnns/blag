I recently reread Stacy Schiff's book on [Samuel Adams](https://stacyschiff.com/the-revolutionary-samuel-adams.html). It came out recently, so I reread it about a year after the first read. I love this guy's story so much. He might be more of a noble rascal than even Ben Franklin, whom I already greatly admire.

Before my first read, I had been curious about Samuel's story because he comes up in interesting ways in the history of John Adams, the second US President, and Samuel's cousin. Each of Adams bio I read mentioned a detail about John's trip to France, during the Revolution, that drops something huge about Samuel and then moves on without explanation. The story usually goes, _while John was in France, he kept getting annoyed by people he met who always asked about his much more famous cousin, Samuel_. In the full context of a book about John, I have found it's surprisingly easy to hear that, take a moment to wonder, "_Wait, what was that? Why was Sam more famous?_" and then forget to ever look him up. It's a book about John after all, not Samuel.

Thomas Jefferson puts him at a particular moment in US history by describing him as "_truly the man of the Revolution_". Samuel is arguably the person most responsible for starting the Revolutionary War. While it's well known Jefferson wrote the Declaration of Independence, it usually isn't mentioned that he lifted a lot of ideas, and even some of the text, from Samuel. Samuel even convinced colonists to drink coffee instead of tea because _[the beeessssst part of waaakiiiing up](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7LXSQ85jpw) is cancel cuuulllllture in yooouuuurrrr cup_.

Beyond the beer, it's been my experience so far that Samuel is barely mentioned, if at all, when the revolutionary story is told. Samuel's actual story turned out to be a huge, incredible surprise. The dude was an unbelievable force of nature. His friends and families saw him as a noble, intelligent, generous, and energetic man. His foes found him so difficult they called him _the Machiavelli of Chaos_. WHAT a description that is. Right?


On both the first read, but especially the second, I kept coming back to a sense that I know people like Samuel. He is someone that went hard on their principles. A lot of people I knew in the east coast music scene were / are like that. We all felt it was a duty to live in alignment with our principles and so we'd also put in the effort to support each other when holding on was hard. That's exactly what Samuel does. Chaos for his enemies, but a gentle, generous, and energetic man for everyone else.

My favorite way to consider is to imagine his crew shouting _We owe you nothing! You have no control!_ as they toss tea into Boston Harbor in 1773. Many of Fugazi's lyrics could be things Samuel said. That's probably why I found it so easy to see myself in his story. I even shouted the same lyrics in a Brooklyn basement in 2023 when I recorded a cover of that Fugazi song. Hit play and let me set the mood for the rest of this read.

If Samuel Adams were alive today, I believe he'd wear a black hoodie and he'd listen to [Fugazi](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_5OZOwAhas&t=187s) or [Propagandhi](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CDhTf3eaeoM). There is an undeniable punk rock attitude throughout his story. By the time I was done with the book the second time, I felt I had to share Sam's story with all my musical friends. I wondered if perhaps they'd see themselves in his story. Maybe my creative, rebellious friends, who are used to feeling the difficulty of living creative, rebellious lives, would feel encouraged by how much they have in common with the people who created the US. They were the outliers. The misfits and the artists. The ones who can be humble while pushing ideas because they already know the ideas are unfuckwithable and they don't have anything to lose anyway.

Maybe his story will inspire everyone to resist when necessary. You know... in case that comes up somehow.


## First, A Quiet Man

> "Among the natural rights of the colonists are these: First a right to life, secondly to liberty, and thirdly to property; together with the right to defend them in the best manner they can."
> â€“ **Samuel Adams**

The first 41 years of Samuel's life are amusingly uneventful. His life is a riches to rags story. He was born in 1722 into one of those New England Puritan families that believed the Church of England hadn't reformed enough. The only thing he really cared about was living virtuously and God. Money wasn't a priority for him at all. He later becomes proud of that and says to a friend that "_poverty is not as disagreeable as wealthy folks would have you believe_." 

He went to Harvard at age 14. His peers at Harvard pulled all kinds of stunts, but Samuel didn't. He was late to something just once and then never again. Samuel didn't respond to flattery and he was distrustful of anyone who did. There were almost no signs of who he'd become until he chose a topic for his Master's thesis: _Is it lawful to resist the supreme magistrate if the republic cannot otherwise be preserved?_

Every now and then you see a glimpse of his potential. It's hard to notice because it's surrounded by his hilarious stories of failure. For example, he inherits his father's matled barley business and ran it into the ground. He'd say he had no mind for all the bookkeeping. The truth is he just didn't care. He loved politics too much to do anything else, but hadn't figured that out yet. Instead, he would act politically by rebelling for causes he believed in, all with almost no regard for the effect it would have on his life. He eventually accumulates more debt than he could repay and was forced to become a tax collector for the King. He hated the whole idea of kings, so he was a bad tax collector on purpose to say ðŸ–• to the whole idea of kings.

The first half of his life was always principled, but the stakes were small. Another way to look at it is that he got a lot of practice figuring out how to get away with principles that disagree with what society expects from him.


## A Wild Man Appears

George Washington gets all kinds of credit in US mythology. It's rarely mentioned that he was a cocky youth who accidentally started the _real_ first world war. George Washington was an ambitious youth. He was just 22 in May 1754 when he commanded a Virginia militia to ambush a French patrol. After killing the patrol, he discovered they were actually a diplomatic mission. England and France were not at war, but this event starts the [French & Indian War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_and_Indian_War), which soon escalates into the [Seven Years' War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seven_Years%27_War), which some historians say is the first real world war. _Oops!_

The Seven Years' War is over by 1763 and Britain wants to protect their property, the colonies, so they send troops. They also want the colonies to pay for that protection through taxes. They had wondered if the colonies would revolt, but Britain assumed that would not work because Ben Franklin's prior attempt at forming a Union of colonies had [failed in 1754](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albany_Plan). Britain would levy a tax on stamps, increasing the cost of communication for the colonists. That tax was the [Stamp Act of 1765](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stamp_Act_1765).

Samuel was having **none of it** and he was already getting in front of them. In May of 1764 he wrote:

> For if our Trade may be taxed why not our Lands? Why not the Produce of our Lands & every thing we possess or make use of? This we apprehend annihilates our Charter Right to govern & tax ourselves â€“ It strikes our British Privileges, which as we have never forfeited them, we hold in common with our Fellow Subjects who are Natives of Britain: If Taxes are laid upon us in any shape without our having a legal Representation where they are laid, are we not reduced from the Character of free Subjects to the miserable State of tributary Slaves

Patrick Henry took up the cause in Virginia. The Pennsylvania Journal printed skulls n crossbones with thick black borders to protest the tax. The New Hampshire Gazette did the same. Massachusetts, Virginia, Pennsylvania, Maryland, Rhode Island, and New York all had protesters in the streets chanting "_no taxation without representation_". The protest was huge and effective. Britain cancelled the Stamp Act and went back to the drawing board.

## Townshould Act By GTFO

Up next were the [Townshend Acts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Townshend_Acts). These were a series of laws that gave Britain the right to both tax and fully administer the colonies. For them, this would remove any ambiguity about who controlled the colonies and it would force the colonists to pay for Britain's activities there.

Samuel was a masterful propagandist, but some of his best work was on display when he and James Otis Jr write the [Massachusetts Circular Letter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massachusetts_Circular_Letter), calling for colonial non-cooperation with Britain. They wanted to _cancel_ Britain. State governments up and down the coast loved it, especially New Jersey, Connecticut, and Virginia. Thomas Jefferson even used it as a template for the Declaration of Independence. 

!["A true patriot would keep the attention of his fellow citizens awake to their grievances, and not allow them to rest till the causes of their just complaints are removed." - Samuel Adams](TruePatriot.jpg)

Britain was livid. They responded with a military occupation of Boston. Believe it or not, that did not have the calming effect Britain was hoping for.


## An Incident & The Massacre

On March 5, 1770, a crowd of ~400 got rowdy and cornered 9 British soldiers. They harassed the soldiers for several blocks while throwing things at them until a soldier fired a shot into the crowd. England called this the _Incident on King Street_, but Samuel and Paul Revere called it [_The Boston Massacre_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Massacre). Britain could not believe the way it was being spun in the colonies. From their perspective, it was an act of self-defense by 9 cornered troops against a mob of 400 angry colonists. From Samuel's perspective, it was an opportunity to agitate the resistance.

## Hot Cup of Cancel Culture

> "Tea must be universally renounced."<br>
> â€“ **John Adams**

One of my favorite examples of Samuel's cancelling prowess is the way he started a trend of choosing coffee over tea. The US still loves coffee. Cancelling tea, and anything else British, was so successful that it brought an already strained East India Company's colonial business to its knees.

This all happened before the Boston Tea Party too, which adds so much context to that event. The East India Company was completely broke when Samuel & The Sons of Liberty threw all that tea in Boston Harbor. To me, that escalates the meaning of the Boston Tea Party from righteous vandalism to an epic _fuck you!_ of historical proportions.

![Boston Tea Party, engraving in W. D. Cooper's The History of North America from 1789](BostonTeaParty.jpg)

By 1774, [John Adams writes a letter to his wife](https://founders.archives.gov/documents/Adams/04-01-02-0087) and he tells her about seeing some travellers who refused to drink tea unless it had been properly smuggled, to which the person running the establishment said "_we have renounced Team in this place. I can't make tea, but He make you Coffee._" John concludes the letter saying he loves coffee and hopes to see Tea universally renounced. 

## First Union

The [Continental Association](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continental_Association) was created in 1774. The colonies were worried about Britain's reaction to the growing colonial boycott against British merchants. Samuel started that boycott and that boycott was why the US had its [First Continental Congress](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Continental_Congress) where the first version of the Union was formed by the delegates from the colonies. Samuel knew what he was doing. The point was always to cultivate colonial cancel culture and to create the right conditions for bringing a new kind of country into being.

Samuel worked out the messaging in a way by trying anything, seeing what worked, and then amplifying the stuff that worked. He published essays about bugs and diseases that were found in the tea leaves Britain got in China, which dissuaded some people. He was known to say a pound of Tea is paid for in buckets of colonial blood shed by the King's men. He also frequented religious gatherings, often singing in choir, to find new audiences for his religious framing of revolutionary ideas.

## Extras

England had no idea what it was getting into with him. It's hard to know the full extent of what he did because he was so good at hiding his tracks and yet it couldn't have been easy to keep 130+ pseudonyms organized. Ben Franklin usually gets credit for being the father of US Intelligence, but Samuel Adams would be more deserving of a statue at CIA headquarters.
