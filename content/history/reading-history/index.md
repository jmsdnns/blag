# Lincoln

This story begins in 2012, when Lincoln was in the theaters. I went on my own one afternoon and came out of the theater bewildered by what I just saw. I knew I saw a story about Lincoln that had all kinds of intense moments, but that was about as far as I got. Any notion I may have had of understanding US history was gone by the time I walked out of the theater.

I went home and clicked around on wikipedia, trying to understand what I was reading, and I felt the weight of discovering some new way in which I am ignorant. I didn't know anything about history!

I knew Lincoln fought a crazy war and freed the slaves, but the movie showed us what he was like as a person, away from the battlefields.

# The Historianization of Jms Dnns

As I read about what Lincoln did outside the war, I started to wonder if I could properly understand the Civil War without knowing all the history that lead up to it.

This was an important moment for me. I had reached a huge question about how to spend my time. I could feel that this might be the start of a new hobby. My previous hobbies were things that stuck with me for years, like skateboarding, playing guitar, or computers. I resist answering the huge questions right away. Instead, I'll dip my toes in the water and see how it feels. It might become a hobby if I enjoy reading it, or maybe it wont.

Ben Franklin was the oldest so it made sense to me to start with a bio about him. I read the Walter Isaacson biography. This book was more or less what I thought reading a thick biography would be like. It was cool, but not too exciting.

I then read Chernow's book on Alexander Hamilton and I couldn't believe what I was reading. I went through this book so fast. One of the best things I've ever read. He truly lived an epic life and the US is lucky to have had him during the crucial early years.

Chernow's book makes Thomas Jefferson out to be such an asshole! Enough so that I thought I would balance my impression of these two by reading a book on Jefferson. I read Meacham's book on Jefferson, The Art Of Power.

This analogy might make historians wince, but I finished that book with the impression that Jefferson is like a Steve Jobs for Revolutionary period. I laughed the first time I pictured Jefferson in a black turtleneck doing a presentation to colonists about thinking differently about King George III, and _one last thing_: **iDeclaration**

More seriously, I couldn't believe what I had read. I wondered if Hamilton vs Jefferson might be like Bill Gates vs Steve Jobs in the 90's. Jefferson was such a scoundrel yet, he's the one that wrote "all men are created equal". Hamilton was one of the most epic people I had ever heard of yet, his life ended too soon because he could also be an epic dummy. And Franklin... as far as I could tell, he was the father socialism, even putting some in the Constitution with the mailbox clause. He was relentlessly curious and civic minded, and yet also a total bullshitter.

I just couldn't believe what I was reading about US history and I wanted to read everything else right away. History was going to be my next hobby.


# A Long March

It wasn't clear to me how I should learn history. There are an overwhelming amount of history books out there. It occurred to me that I could read at least one biography of every President. That would take me in the right direction through all the layers. I figured those biographies would teach me enough that I could find books for deeper explorations of anything interesting.

I started with Ron Chernow's book on Washington. I wanted another page turner, like Hamilton, but Washington just wasn't that kind of person. He was flawed, as any of the founder, but he genuinely gave everything he could in service of his country. Never strayed from duty. And when the time came, he became the first US President to peacefully hand power over to their successor. We take that for granted now, but it must have been magnificent back then.


# Many Years Later

I have read a lot of history since 2012. I understand the US as a country that came existence at a time when the whole process could be documented right from the start. We can actually know what people felt, what they thought, and what they said as everything took place. The context is rich with fascinating people asking huge questions about how to live on this planet without killing each other all time.

One thing I have learned, is that both the Revolution and the Civil War have so much detail that I have spent many years of my years reading history focused on just them. I have only recently come out of the Civil War, putting me in the context for Reconstruction. I don't expect to leave this context for many years, and then I'll have the wild early 1900's before me, & then WW1, & on, & on.

History indeed rhymes, as they say. One of my favorite surprises from having historical knowledge is that you can spot when modern life is following patterns we have seen before, and watch as they unfold with actual people. We'd like to think we've advanced, relative to people 200 years ago, but we're the same in so many ways too.
