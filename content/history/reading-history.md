# Lincoln

This story begins in 2012, when Lincoln was in the theaters. I went on my own one afternoon and came out of the theater bewildered by what I just saw. I knew I saw a story about Lincoln that had all kinds of intense moments, but that was about as far as I got. Any notion I may have had of understanding US history was gone by the time I walked out of the theater.

I went home and clicked around on wikipedia, trying to understand what I was reading, and I felt the weight of discovering some new way in which I am ignorant. I didn't know anything about history!

I knew Lincoln fought a crazy war and freed the slaves, but the movie showed us what he was like as a person, away from the battlefields.

This scene shows Lincoln's hilarious side. The real Lincoln loved telling this story.


# Should I?

As I read about what Lincoln did outside the war, I started to wonder if I could properly understand the Civil War without knowing all the history that lead up to it.

This was an important moment for me. I had reached a huge question about how to spend my time. I could feel that this might be the start of a new hobby. My previous hobbies were things that stuck with me for years, like skateboarding, playing guitar, or computers. I resist answering the huge questions right away. Instead, I'll dip my toes in the water and see how it feels. It might become a hobby if I enjoy reading it, or maybe it wont.

Ben Franklin was the oldest so it made sense to me to start with a bio about him. I read the Walter Isaacson biography. This book was more or less what I thought reading a thick biography would be like. It was cool, but not too exciting.

I then read Chernow's book on Alexander Hamilton and I couldn't believe what I was reading. I went through this book so fast. One of the best things I've ever read. He truly lived an epic life and the US is lucky to have had him during the crucial early years.

Chernow's book makes Thomas Jefferson out to be such an asshole! Enough so that I thought I would balance my impression of these two by reading a book on Jefferson. I read Meacham's book on Jefferson, The Art Of Power.

This analogy might make historians wince, but I finished that book with the impression that Jefferson is like a Steve Jobs for Revolutionary period. I laughed the first time I pictured Jefferson in a black turtleneck doing a presentation to colonists about thinking differently about King George III, and _one last thing_: **iDeclaration**

More seriously, I couldn't believe what I had read. I wondered if Hamilton vs Jefferson might be like Bill Gates vs Steve Jobs in the 90's. Jefferson was such a scoundrel yet, he's the one that wrote "all men are created equal". Hamilton was one of the most epic people I had ever heard of yet, his life ended too soon because he could also be an epic dummy. And Franklin... as far as I could tell, he was the father socialism, even putting some in the Constitution with the mailbox clause. He was a relentlessly curious, civic minded, and yet also a total bullshitter.

History was going to be my next hobby. I just couldn't believe what I had read and I wanted to read everything else right away.


# March Through Presidential Bios

It wasn't clear to me how I should learn history. There are an overwhelming amount of history books out there. It occurred to me that I could read at least one biography of every President. That would take me in the right direction through all the layers. I figured those biographies would teach me enough that I could find books for deeper explorations of anything interesting.

I started with Ron Chernow's book on Washington. I wanted another page turner, like Hamilton, but Washington just wasn't that kind of person. He was flawed, as any of the founder, but he genuinely gave everything he could in service of his country. Never strayed from duty. And when the time came, he became the first US President to peacefully hand power over to their successor. We take that for granted now, but it must have been magnificent back then.


# 11 Years Later

I have read a lot of history since 2012. Both the Revolution and the Civil War are black holes. I have only recently come out of the Civil War and I've been reading for 11 years!

There are recurring themes in history. It rhymes, as they say. One of my favorite surprises from having history knowledge is that you can spot when modern life starts rhyming with history, and watch as patterns you've read about unfold with actual people. We'd like to think we're advanced relative to people 200 years ago, but we're the same in so many ways too. It is humbling to see it every day.
