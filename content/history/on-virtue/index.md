    There's a good chance that anyone living in the US has heard the term "virtue signaling". It is usually used to mock someone attempting to hold others to a high standard of conduct. If the founders of the US were alive today, they would be horrified to consider the US has descended into a country that mocks virtue. All of them cared deeply about it, especially George Washington. We all should. Knowing what they said about it will help.

There's a good chance that anyone living in the US has heard the term _virtue signaling_. It is usually used to mock someone attempting to hold others to a high standard of conduct. Those people are idiots. I'd even wager they consider themselves patriotic. If the founders of the US were alive today, they would be horrified by such behavior. All of the US founders cared deeply about virtue, especially George Washington.

Prior to the 2016 election, my experience of government in the US was that it seemed like it rarely got anything done and that this was fine because the people of the US were going to do whatever they want all the time anyway. We're free to be amazing and we're free to be awful! We're also supposed to reconcile with each other either by sorting out our differences or by going to court.

Everyone in the US had moments where they understood something new about the change taking place that year. The GOP changed. That much is undeniable. Whether or not that is a good thing has been a source of intense conversation ever since. My perspective about what was taking place was different from my friends because I had been reading history.

More specifically, I had a sense of how Madison thought about government when he designed the one we use in the US. I understood enough to have a sense that any cynicism I had ever experience in life would never match the cynicism required for him to come up with the design he made. It's genuinely impressive. It comes from a life where he was teased for the seizures he experienced, due to epilepsy. He also watched Christians wield Virginia's government against other forms of Christianity, because Virginia had an official church back then. We can understand so much about who he was from a single quote: "_if men were angels, we wouldn't need government._"

The most impactful breakthrough I had, while trying to see things the he did, was when I realized Madison actually thought about it all as though everyone involved actually is the worst person of all time. From that, we can understand the rest. The government starts by articulating the gist of how the system works. It then provides 10 laws and tells everyone to break out into subgroups to handle everything else. If something is missing, add it. But there's a catch, it's damn near impossible to change anything. The governments are all made of a lot of people and it's pretty much impossible to get them to agree enough to do anything, which means the intended user experience for his design is that it basically never works and we're fighting all the time.

WTF, man!

That's obviously not the whole story. Before the Constitutional Convention he had been on perhaps the most productive study session of all time. A US government existed under the Articles of Confederacy and he was already sure it wouldn't hold. He wanted to study why confederacies had failed in history and do whatever he could to improve the US government. So that's what he did for a few years. He just read and read and eventually realized they all fail because it was too easy for a small group, often a single member nation, to block action and infighting would take care of the rest. He wanted something that was stronger, but also something of a mediator. He decided a federal gov and state govs and it won't be so clear which is more powerful. He did this all over the government. For any force going in one direction, they would be opposing forces stopping them from action unless they agreed with it.

He didn't trust anyone to do anything, so he made it nearly impossible to do anything. The main idea is that the worst person in the world will probably gain power at some point, but they will be rendered useless because all the other parts of the government can, in theory, block him. I'll say it again, a total tyrant can gain power and the US gov can protects itself by not going anything, especially when the tyrant wants it to.

WHO builds a useless government ON PURPOSE?! James Madison. He even believed this default mode of being useless was why it could scale up and up in size. In Federalist 10 he makes the case that adding more people to the Union is not conducive to agreement. If anything, it makes it harder to agree. From Madison's POV, a tyrant becomes increasingly restrained as the Union gets bigger, so add as many states as you want and we're still good!

Madison wasn't alone in his fear of those who seek power. They all worried about it. Many of them had studied Rome's collapse and come to the conclusion that corruption is something that cannot be stopped by a law or a design of government. Instead, the idea would to turn everyone against each other in a search for reasons their opposition is not fit to lead. The gameified rooting out corruption. 

It's not always easy to know what someone means when they say corruption. One way to consider it is by imagining an ideal leader, one of great virtue, and then we attempt to consider how different someone is from that. How ideal is defined will change over time as new generations take over, so the pursuit of virtue itself is the thing we want. Living virtuously can be thought of as living without as much corruption as possible. That's exactly what we want for people in government!

Neither the wisest constitution nor the wisest laws will secure the liberty and happiness of a people whose manners are universally corrupt.  He therefore is the truest friend of the liberty of his country who tries most to promote its virtue.<br>
– **Samuel Adams**

![John Adams](johnadams.png)
Public virtue cannot exist in a nation without private virtue, and public virtue is the only foundation of republics.<br>
– **John Adams**

![Thomas Jefferson](tommyjeffs.png)

No government can continue good but under the control of the people; and … their minds are to be informed by education what is right and what wrong; to be encouraged in habits of virtue and to be deterred from those of vice … These are the inculcations necessary to render the people a sure basis for the structure and order of government.<br>
– **Thomas Jefferson**

![James Madison](jamsmadison.png)

To suppose that any form of government will secure liberty or happiness without any virtue in the people, is a chimerical imaginary idea.<br>
– **James Madison**

A vitiated impure state of morals, a corrupted public conscience, is incompatible with freedom.<br>
– **Patrick Henry**
