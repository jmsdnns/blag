    This dude read Marx, thought he was basically right, and then wondered why a Marxian revolution never took place. He comes to believe entrepreneurship was a more productive outlet than violence and he framed this alternative form of revolution as Creative Destruction. His ideas permeate modern life, especially for tech, and yet he is far from being a household name. We'll get into his influences, how he reconciles with Marx, and what his ideas offer as a lens for the current moment.

It's hard to believe, but there was a time when Capitalism didn't feel inevitable. Multiple times, actually. When considered across several centuries, arguments can be made that material social advancement happens as long waves of amazing things with tech, followed by more calm periods where society finds the new tech boring and ordinary. Creative folks get bored during the calm periods and create the next long term wave. Schumpeter's ideas are the foundation of these arguments.

To understand Schumpeter, we must put ourselves in the shoes of someone who left Germany for the US in the 1920's and witnessed the wild wealth of the roaring 20's, then the great depression, and then the build up for World War II. And, at somewhere along the way, he studied Marx. Schumpeter is a capitalist, to be clear, but he also felt like Marx nailed his critique. He then wondered _if Marx was right, why didn't a place like the US ever have the predicted Marxian Revolution?_ Regardless of where you lie on the political spectrum, this is a very interesting question.

Arguments for capitalism often include praising its dynamism and wealth-creation power. History also shows a persistent tendency towards groups accumulating enough power that they are outside democratic accountability. Folks alive today already know capitalism produces wealth. Schumpeter wondered about what happens when a company is so powerful that they can easily squash anyone that attempts to compete? Schumpeter essentially reframes what Marx said into the perspective of a capitalist. He acknowledges the dangers Marx saw and responds by saying _this will sound crazy, but I have a theory that all that stuff is actually manageable_.

A key detail for Schumpeter is that he believed any capitalist society will eventually eat itself. He believed capitalism's greatest threat was not its failures, but its success. Modern critiques of capitalism are full of detail about what happens when capitalism goes wrong, and Schumpeter would probably agree with them. He'd then try to solve the problems they described. That's what makes him a capitalist, ultimately, even though his book also says socialism is inevitable. He wanted to slow down socialism's arrival so that the pressure cooker of capitalism keeps its creative momentum going as long as possible.

I want to trace a line from Adam Smith through David Ricardo to Marx, and then to Schumpeter's concept of _creative destruction_, an idea so important Schumpeter is the third most cited economist, after both Marx and Smith.
