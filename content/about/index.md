# Career

I tend to stay near the **creative side of tech**, exploring things that aren't yet well understood.  I am as comfortable being the person who writes the first line of code as I am navigating a huge project. I adore how fast we can move with modern technology, especially with small teams, and I embrace each opportunity.

I have worked with a wide range of organizations, such as **Spotify**, **Venmo**, **HBOMax**, **Splice**, **The Whitney Museum**, **VHX**, **The Robin Hood Foundation**, **Bear Stearns** _and then JPMorgan_, **Harvard Law School**, and **Johns Hopkins University**.

I studied computer science at **Northeastern University**, and I was in the inaugural batch of **Recurse Center**.

Though my early career resembles a dog chasing a ball, I prefer to focus on fewer things while building deeper expertise. Lately, my focus is on **machine learning** && **MLOps**.


# Tech

I am a polyglot, but I typically build things for the web or for doing ML at scale, and so I typically write code in **Javascript or Python** or I'm building infrastructure on a cloud to run it all. I love learning new languages, or databases, or new libraries. I just started studying **Rust**, for example.

I sometimes work on open source software and I sometimes start open source projects. Of all the projects I've started, [**Schematics**](https://github.com/schematics/schematics) is my favorite. It is a type system for Python that handles human types, like email addresses, URLs, etc. [**Brubeck**](https://github.com/j2labs/brubeck) was a concurrent server framework with strong opinions on web serving, concurrency, data modeling, and messaging. And [**Micro Army**](https://github.com/jmsdnns/microarmy) was a tool I made for testing Brubeck's performance. It works by instantiating a few hundred AWS Micros to flood some URL with requests and report back about the performance.

One of the more rewarding aspects of open source is learning where your work turns up. You've used where my open source played a role if you talk to Apple devices, read Huffington Post, or wear Warby Parker sunglasses.

I have also teamed up with friends to build several tech communities: **Hack && Tell**, **Brooklyn Swift**, and **Dumbo Tech Breakfast**.


# Music

I first picked up a guitar around 11, had my first band a couple years later, made a few records before finishing high school, and soon enough, I was in a van touring the US & Canada. I've had several bands since then, written a lot of music, and I still play live. I haven't toured in years, though.

I tell the stories for each project, with music, pics, and youtube, in my [musical history]({{< ref "music" >}}).


# History

I have been reading history since 2012. I explain how that happened [in this post]({{< ref "reading-history" >}}).

History is fascinating for many reasons, but my favorite stuff is when people make a point of historical significance in some absurd way.

I recently began [writing about history]({{< ref "history" >}}). There will be times I celebrate the absurd and there will be times I tell more serious stories. My goal is to write about history in a way that makes new fans of reading history.
