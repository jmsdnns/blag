# Career

I tend to stay near the creative side of tech so I can explore things that aren't yet well understood.  I am as comfortable being the person who writes the first line of code as I am navigating a huge project. I adore how fast we can move with modern technology, especially with small teams, and I embrace each opportunity to get better at making things faster.

I have worked with a wide range of organizations, such as **Spotify**, **Venmo**, **HBOMax**, **Splice**, **The Whitney Museum**, **VHX**, **The Robin Hood Foundation**, **Bear Stearns** _and then JPMorgan_, **University of Pennsylvania**, **Harvard Law School**, and **Johns Hopkins University**.

I studied computer science at **Northeastern University**, and I was in the inaugural batch of **Recurse Center**.

Though my early career resembles a dog chasing a ball, I prefer to focus on fewer things while building deeper expertise. Lately, this means I focus on machine learning and systems programming.


# Tech

I have been all over the place when it comes tech. I feel lucky because my career has given me the opportunity to build at least one of just about everything. I have built backends, frontends, mobile apps, infrastructures, ML pipelines, ML algorithms, and I have mentored others on all of the above too. My goal is to use as much of my time as possible for building things that make the world a little bit better. The tech I use in pursuit of that isn't as important as what is being built.

With that said, lately I have been using Rust and Python. I'm also learning React Native on the side. Python is the language of machine learning, Rust is what I want to use everywhere else, and React Native let's me build mobile apps without thinking too hard about how iOS and Android are different.

I have started several open source projects over the years. Of all the projects I've started, [**Schematics**](https://github.com/schematics/schematics) is my favorite. It is a type system for Python that handles human types, like email addresses, URLs, etc. [**Brubeck**](https://github.com/j2labs/brubeck) was a concurrent server framework with strong opinions on web serving, concurrency, data modeling, and messaging. And [**Micro Army**](https://github.com/jmsdnns/microarmy) was a tool I made for testing Brubeck's performance. It works by instantiating a few hundred AWS Micros to flood some URL with requests and report back about the performance. _I'm working on a new version of Micro Army in Rust, but it isn't released yet._

One of the more rewarding aspects of open source is learning where your work turns up. You've used probably interested with my work if you talk to Apple devices, pay people with Venmo, watch Criterion Collection on a mobile device, read Huffington Post, or wear Warby Parker sunglasses.

I get great joy from bringing people together to share the things we've learned. I especially love when the design of the community causes everyone involved to learn more about their interests faster than if they were alone. Some of the better known tech communities built by me and my friends are: **Hack && Tell**, **Brooklyn Swift**, and **Dumbo Tech Breakfast**.


# Music

I first picked up a guitar around 11, had my first band a couple years later, made a few records before finishing high school, and soon enough, I was in a van touring the US & Canada. I've had several bands since then, written a lot of music, and I still play live. I haven't toured in years, though.

I tell the stories for each project, with music, pics, and youtube, in my [musical history]({{< ref "music" >}}).


# History

I have been reading history since 2012. I explain how that happened [in this post]({{< ref "reading-history" >}}).

History is fascinating for many reasons, but my favorite stuff is when people make a point of historical significance in some absurd way.

I recently began [writing about history]({{< ref "history" >}}). There will be times I celebrate the absurd and there will be times I tell more serious stories. My goal is to write about history in a way that makes new fans of reading history.
