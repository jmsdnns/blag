# About

I'm James Dennis. I transform ideas into tangible things—whether that's software, music, or writing. I'm happiest when I'm building something new or learning something deeply.


## Work

I've worked across the stack, primarily doing backends, infrastructure, and ML pipelines, with the occasional frontend or mobile app. Currently, I work primarily in Python and Rust. My approach is to transform ideas into working systems quickly, with small teams or established organizations.

I built data pipelines & backends for Spotify, a payments gateway and deployment tooling for Venmo, and ML pipelines that processed hundreds of terabytes of video and audio for HBOMax. I developed a mobile player for VHX (_acquired by Vimeo_) and an event admission system for The Whitney Museum's biennial. At UPenn, I built a cheating detection tool, helped construct Coursera lessons, contributed to the design of their new AI degree programs, and published ML research with [Chris Callison-Burch](https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~ccb/).

Through J2 Labs, my former consultancy, I built many backends and infrastructures for numerous smaller companies, some acquired, others that ran their course as early stage companies do.

My open source creations include [Schematics](http://github.com/schematics/schematics) (a type system for Python focused on human data types), [Brubeck](https://github.com/j2labs/brubeck) (a concurrent server framework), and [Micro Army](https://github.com/jmsdnns/microarmy) (a distributed load testing tool). I'm currently rewriting Micro Army in Rust as [Killa Beez](https://github.com/jmsdnns/killabeez). Users of my open source projects include Apple, Huffington Post, Warby Parker, and Criterion Collection.

I co-founded several tech communities including [Hack && Tell](https://hackandtell.org), Brooklyn Swift, and Dumbo Tech Breakfast. I studied computer science at Northeastern University and attended [Recurse Center's](https://recurse.com) inaugural batch.


## Music

I first picked up a guitar around 11, had my first band a couple years later, made a few records before finishing high school, and soon enough, I was in a van touring the US & Canada. I’ve had several bands since then, written a lot of music, and I still play live. I haven’t toured in years, though.

I tell the stories for each project, with music, pics, and youtube, in [my musical history]({{< ref "music" >}}).


## History

I've been reading history since 2012. I explain how that happened [in this post]({{< ref "reading-history" >}}).

I'm drawn to moments where historical figures designed memorable ways to communicate their ideas—Leonardo da Vinci and Eleanor Roosevelt are favorites. For them, it wasn’t enough to get their point across. They wanted history to remember their message too.

[I write about history]({{< ref "history" >}}) with the goal of making it accessible and engaging for new readers.



## Contact

You can always find me at this website because I intend to keep this URL for the rest of my life. It's my name, without the vowels, dot com.
