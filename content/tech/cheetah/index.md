    Last year, I was on a team that worked on the class designs for UPenn's new AI degree programs. We were quite concerned about how well cheating with AI might work. There was a lot of speculation, but that ain't my style, so I rolled up my sleeves and got hacking until I had a tool, Cheetah, that could tell us just how cheatable the classes really were.
