I have been thinking about something Jean Baudrillard said a lot recently. It comes to mind because of things happening around generative AI.

Prior to the current moment, I believed he was more cynical than necessary. The current moment changed that for me because it I now wonder if we might actually bring about some of the futures Baudrillard talked about. In particular, a future where art dies.

> Art does not die because there is no more art. It dies because there is too much.
>
> â€” Jean Baudrillard

That quote has been in my mind because it causes me to consider difficult questions that don't have clear answers. What happens to art in a world where AI can generate more art at overwhelming speed? Could he have been right after all, and art dies because new tools let us make too much of it? What does mean for artists too?


## Artists Gonna Art

Baudrillard was a philosopher, so it makes sense he would expand questions about the meaning of art until he reached the existential questions about how _art_ dies. He worries that great art will get lost in the sea of noise created by a flood of ordinary art. Art's power to describe, compel, and renew would fade into obscurity and get replaced with art that is little more than, in his words, "a meta-language for banality".

_Wait a sec... did he just say we're losers with nothing interesting to say?! Screw that guy! Why should **we** care what **he** thinks?! Maybe we want to hide in the sea of noise? Maybe we don't care about the mainstream?! Maybe that isn't where we want to be at all! Maybe we are different because our ideas are better?!_

For creative folks, the rebellion is automatic. It is a side effect of being different enough to have experiences that require defending a nonconsensus view. Consider someone you know with strong opinions outside the norm, wouldn't they laugh if we said the people they disagree with are _a sea of noise_? Imagine the punk below sarcastically saying they're scared of not fitting in.

Creativty starts with seeing the world as a thing that can be modified or improved upon. Every experience is an opportunity to have ideas about some new context. Over time, they become good at generating streams of ideas, each of which is a potential divergence from the status quo. Simply imagine _something different_ from _what is_ enough times to have lots of ideas for improving _what is_ and the status quo inevitably becomes a dumpster fire to be avoided.

Being creative alone can be satisfying, but being creative with others is extraordinary. The things we create can become something bigger than any individual when several perspectives work together.

Finding other people comfortable with constantly analyzing our experiences as we generate ideas is frustrating. All creative thinkers eventually find out the hard way that most people are not creative thinkers. A typical person experiences a creative personal thinking out loud as though the creative has no clue what they are talking about. That isn't totally wrong, because sharing both the good and bad ideas as they had them, not yet aware of which ones are good or bad. Typical people don't catch the subtle cues that discard bad ideas while collecting the good ones, so it reaches them as a jumbled mess.

Artistic communities can be built around groups of creative folks that are sick of that experience. They want to spend time with folks who are also sick of that experience. They pride themselves on the way they diverge from the norm. It expresses who they are, relative to the norm. The differences are part of their identity. After all, what even is an artist if not someone who wants to convey a unique perspective?


## Art and Art Forms

Art, as a concept, can be hard to define. It comes in many forms. Some folks claim that everything is art. Leonardo da Vinci saw things that way. Abstractly, art is some expression of feelings, thoughts, and perspectives. More tangibly, art is usually the result of some effort applied towards creating something, like a painting, a poem, a building, clothing, a video game, etc. 

Humans have been making art for a long time. There are [neanderthal cave drawings](https://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/oldest-known-neanderthal-engravings-discovered-in-french-cave-180982408/) in France that go back 57,000 years. The oldest known "representational" art is an Indonesian [cave painting of a pig](https://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/45000-year-old-pig-painting-indonesia-may-be-oldest-known-animal-art-180976748/) that goes back 45,500 years. The oldest known depiction of a human, the [Venus of Hohle Fels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venus_of_Hohle_Fels), is from 40,000 years ago. 

I struggle to believe that humans will stop expressing themselves anytime soon, let alone while I'm here to see it, so I don't believe art will stop being made. The mediums we use to create art, or _art forms_, are different. They are more transient. They exist as one of the possible ways humans can express themselves. Art forms _can_ die. They die when humans don't care enough to use them anymore.

It is more interesting for me to consider when they become part of some larger art form instead. It stops being _the_ consideration and joins other art forms as _one of many_ considerations working together. For example, we usually experience poetry as lyrics in a song. We experience more photography as frames in some video than as individual photographs. Both music and video have rich histories with extraordinary ingenuity behind them, but they're just one of the many things a computer might do when we play video games.


## E Pluribus Unum Systema

As of recently, we live in a world where computers can generate art that is so good we now struggle with distinguishing between art made by humans and art made by algorithms. And more, the new systems can generate the works almost instantly. Consider waiting a few minutes next to the time required for humans to gain an artistic skill and then use it to produce works. 

From a purely practical perspective, skilled humans may not be necessary the same way they have been up to now. In theory, a lot of the former constraints in making art have been removed, which could mean we will see an enormous increase in how much art gets made. This becomes existential if we consider what Baudrillard said again. I'll frame it as a question. _Could genAI cause us to make so much art that art dies?_

I don't worry about art dying, as I said earlier, but I do worry about all the people who have spent years honing their skills and creating amazing things. If their work can be digitized, it can also be used as training data for AIs. The Internet has driven us through doing a lot of that digitization work already, too.

It is legally ambiguous, as of now, whether or not AI companies have to pay for the right to use all that work as training data. We can probably assume companies will be companies, though. They will probably attempt whatever gives them the most advantages and they will probably assume it's all legal. Services already exist for using AI to generate high quality music on demand, like [Udio](https://www.udio.com/) or [Suno](https://suno.com/).

![What do you do when your foundation falls apart? I don't know. They don't teach you that at school.](nofoundation.gif)

_I do not believe it is legal, fwiw. I expect the courts to get very active in resolving the rights issues in AI. Alas, that hasn't happened yet._
